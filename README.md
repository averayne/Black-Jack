# Black Jack

### Objective
- Beat the dealer by ending the round with a hand value closer to 21 without going over.
- A natural blackjack (Ace + 10-value card on the initial deal) is the best possible hand.

### Card Values
- Numbered cards count at face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Aces count as 1 or 11, whichever benefits the hand most.

### Initial Deal
- Each player receives two face-up cards; the dealer receives one face-up "upcard" and one face-down "hole card."
- If a player has a natural blackjack and the dealer does not, that player usually wins immediately and is paid 3:2 unless house rules specify otherwise.

### Player Options
- **Hit:** Take another card to increase the hand total.
- **Stand:** Take no more cards and keep the current total.
- **Double Down:** Double the original bet, take exactly one additional card, then stand.
- **Split:** If the first two cards have the same value, split them into two separate hands with a matching bet on the new hand; play continues on each hand independently.
- **Surrender (if available):** Forfeit half the bet immediately to end the hand.

### Dealer Rules
- After all players act, the dealer reveals the hole card.
- The dealer must draw cards until the hand totals at least 17.
- Most tables require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17" (a 17 containing an Ace counted as 11), but some require the dealer to stand.

### Settling Hands
- If a player busts (exceeds 21), the bet is lost immediately, regardless of the dealer's future outcome.
- If the dealer busts, all remaining players win their bets.
- Otherwise, totals are compared: the higher total wins, and equal totals are a push (bet returned).
- Insurance and side-bet payouts follow the specific table rules and are optional.
